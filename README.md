1 Arduino UNO <br>
1 Ethernet Shield <br>
1 Micro SD card <br>
1 Sensor RFID <br>
üí° - To make this project I used the integrated Ethernet Shield sensor that can read Micro SD card

üñ•Ô∏è There are some comments inside the code that can help you to undestand the methods. <br>
‚ö†Ô∏è This is a simple adaptation of my real code. <br>
‚å®Ô∏è About the real code, I made this program for my scientific project, because we needed to save the students who came 
for lectures at my school. As all students have a School ID card that has a Radio Frequency Identification,
so with this project, students who come to the lectures just need to approch their card and our system saves
this information, so that we can use this data in our scientific project. <br>
‚ÑπÔ∏è If you have any question or problems in your project using this code base, send me an email, it will be a pleasure to help you.
